# access_mysqli
Simple single-file MySql database access application, written in PHP.

Just load the file to your server and that's it.

## Features
- Create/delete databases and tables
- Rename and copy tables, even in different databases
- Add columns/rows
- Edit the name and datatypes of columns
- Reorder columns
- Edit the content of a cell without reloading page
- Order the content of the table by multiple keys
- HTML editing with some basic formatting: font size, color, bold, italic, underline, alignment, lists, link insertion
- Smart seamless jump from one cell to the other while editing content
- Auto-sync with the server when you leave the edited cell.
- Import/export database and tables in `.sql` format
- Advanced search features, such as match word, begin/end with, regex, search on particular columns, show only rows containing results
- Advanced edit feature for entering MySql functions
- Send own SQL query

The application is available in two languages: [english](en/access_mysqli.php) and [romanian](ro/access_mysqli.php).

## NOTE
Don not change file name `access_mysqli.php`!

I'm sure the application works with PHP 5.6+, but I expect it to do well with some lower versions.
